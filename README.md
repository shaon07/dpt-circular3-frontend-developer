## Time Spend

Basically i have done this project in my free time after came from office. so i have take 3 days and give everyday 2-3 hours. after doing this i cofidently say that if i give my full time as i give in my office works then it will not take more then 3-4 hours.

I have also worked with some frontend design system. that's why every components are resuable and scalable. and I hope every developer should understand the coding patters very well.
